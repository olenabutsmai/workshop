# Topic:
## _Frames, groups and sections in Figma_
### Progress:
> 1. Select the Basic level. Start by creating a frame for the base. After that, complete the rest of the work and aim for a result that is equal to the original example..

> 2. Select the Medium level. Once the frame is ready, look closely at the example picture. Make sure to maintain all proportions.
